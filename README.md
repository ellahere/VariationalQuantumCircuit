# VariationalQuantumCircuit
This notebook performs the second screening task. 
In it I build a Variational Quantum Circuit with fidelity as loss. 
The code is inspired by https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_data_reuploading_classifier.html and https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_state_preparation.html.
